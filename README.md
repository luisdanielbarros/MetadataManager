# MetadataManager

Copies set of images A for each of your subscribers into new sets X1, X2, X..., injecting user-specific metadata into each image.
Were any of your subscribers to leak this injected content, you could possibly identify them by reading the image's metadata. 
Deepweb FBI honeypots are rumored to use stuff like this, no idea how it stands in court, it's a guarantee 
to the source of the image (assuming noone's injecting metadata exactly similar to yours to your images and sharing them online, what odds) and a helpful tracer.

I recommend to read in the following order:

3. Classes
4. API
